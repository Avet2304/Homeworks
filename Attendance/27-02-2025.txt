Today's topic was threads. Threads enable a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which enhances efficiency, especially in multi-core systems.

We also covered:

sleep() – This function pauses a program’s execution for a specified duration (either in seconds or milliseconds).
malloc() – This function dynamically allocates memory at runtime, returning a pointer to the allocated space.
