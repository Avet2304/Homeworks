Bitwise operations work by manipulating individual bits of integers. These operations are useful for optimizing performance, setting flags, and handling low-level programming tasks.

Pointers, on the other hand, store memory addresses, which allow direct access and manipulation of data. They are essential for efficient memory management, dynamic allocation, and passing data efficiently between functions.
