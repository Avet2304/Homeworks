In the second class, we discussed Unix and Linux, highlighting their differences. Unix is an older operating system, while Linux is similar but offers more flexibility and is free to use.

In the second part of the class, we covered about 30 essential Linux commands. Some of the key ones included:

ls (lists the contents of a folder)
cd (navigates between directories)
mkdir (creates directories)
cp (copies files)
mv (moves a file or folder)

And many others.
